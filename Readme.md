# Verso

Verso explores the idea of using JSX as a declarative language to describe graphics.

The beauty about using JSX is that it’s compiled in a tree structure, that can then be send to different renderers, rendering the graphics to the desired format.

Currently very simple Canvas and SVG renderers for browser environments, as well as a simple SVG renderer for node.js environments are explored.

**This is just an experiment for now, there’s a million things to be explored before this is even remotely useful**
